        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1/2 medium onion chopped</li>
        <li>1 pound extra lean ground beef</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic minced</li>
        <li>1 (14 fluid ounce) can diced tomatoes with juices</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon Dijon mustard</li>

        <li>3/4 cup heavy/whipping cream</li>

        <li>Freshly grated parmesan cheese</li>
        <li></li>
    </ul>
    <h5>step by step instructions</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil a salted pot of water for the pasta and cook it al dente according to package directions.</li>
        <li>Add the onion and olive oil to a large skillet (or small pot/Dutch oven) and cook for 4-5 minutes over medium-high heat.
        </li>
        <li>Add in the ground beef and garlic and continue cooking for another 8 minutes or so until the beef has browned (break the meat up with your spoon as you go along). Spoon out excess fat if there's a lot of it.
        </li>
        <li>Stir in the canned tomatoes, tomato paste, Dijon mustard, and Italian seasoning. Simmer for 4-5 minutes or until the sauce has reduced somewhat.</li>
        <li>Stir in the cream and cook for another 3-5 minutes (it'll warm through and reduce a bit).</li>
        <li>Season with salt & pepper as needed and toss with the drained pasta. Serve with parmesan cheese if desired.
        </li>
    </ol>
